# School_District_Analysis

## Background: 
    The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv 
    file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for 
    Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board 
    does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing 
    standards and have turned to Maria for help.
    
### Requirements:
    1. Replace ninth-grade reading and math scores
    2. Repeat the school district analysis
    3. A written report for the school district analysis
    
### Replace ninth-grade reading and math scores:  
    - Using the Pandas loc method with conditional statements and comparison and logical operators, 
    - Select the ninth-grade reading and math scores for Thomas High School. 
    - Use the Pandas NumPy module to change the reading and math scores to NaN.
    
### Repeat the School District Analysis
    - The district summary
    - The school summary
    - The top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
    - The average math score for each grade level from each school
    - The average reading score for each grade level from each school
    - The scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type
    
### Written Report for the School District Analysis that summarizes your updated analysis and compares 
    it with the results from the module.
    
    The analysis should contain the following:

    1. Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

    2. Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.
        - How is the district summary affected?
        - How is the school summary affected?
        - How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance 
        - relative to the other schools?
        - How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
            a) Math and reading scores by grade
            b) Scores by school spending
            c) Scores by school size
            d) Scores by school type
     3. Summary: Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for
